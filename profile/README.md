# The Vim Vanguard
„In the sprawling digital realm of Vim, the Vim Vanguards, a fellowship of master coders, rose to face an insidious bug known as Segfault, threatening the very fabric of their world. Led by Lorax 'the Learner,' they embarked on a perilous quest through dense thickets of Cryptic Code and the swirling mists of Obfuscation to retrieve the legendary Patch, the only force capable of restoring order. Battling the Daemon of Deadlock in the cavernous Archive and wielding powerful Vim commands, they secured the Patch and vanquished Segfault, their victory illuminating the domain and forever sealing their legacy as the guardians of Vim.“

**not actually our goal, but sounds good**
